# React Template
### a perosnalized template built on top of create-react-app that has my standard dependencies and setup all ready to go
- clone into a new folder with `git clone https://github.com/avelaga/react-template.git <folder-name>`
- remove origin with  `git remote remove origin`
- create a new github repo
- connect new repo with `git remote add origin <repo-link>`
- push and finished setup to new repo with `git push -u origin master`

now you're good to go and use it as a new project
